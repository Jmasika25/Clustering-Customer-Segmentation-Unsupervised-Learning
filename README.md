# Clustering-Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervised-Learning

## Project Overview

The project involved:

### 1. Loading the dataset and Basic EDA

Here, plots such as Histograms and bar plots were used to study the distribution of data.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Filtering

Missing values, Duplicates and Filtering were performed on the data making it ready for analysis.

### 3. Aggregation and Feature Engineering

New variables were created such as income to age ratio, some variables were transformed and others dropped.

### 4. Visualizations and Group exploration

### 5. Dimensionality Reduction

Here, PCA was applied to the data, then clustering was performed using the reduced dimensions data.

- PCA
- t-SNE

KMeans clustering and Hierarchical Clustering were studied and compared.

- Dendrograms
- Elbow Method and Inertia
